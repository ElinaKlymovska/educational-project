This web-application based on the Spring Framework was created gradually during the Java marathon. 
During the training I got acquainted with Spring Data, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Junit, Mockito, 
and also understood the specifics of teamwork on an IT product with different people.

The work was divided into 18 sprints during which we consistently created this REST web application:
1. Class Design. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance. Polymorphism
3. Inner, outer class. Enum
4. Generics. Collections
5. Exceptions
6. Functional Interfaces. Lambda
7. Stream API. Date and Time. I / O Streams
8. Multithreading
9. Annotations
10. JDBC
11. Servlets
12. Introduction To Spring. IoC
13. ORM. Hibernate. Part 1
14. ORM. Hibernate. Part 2
15. Spring MVC
16. Unit Testing. Logging
17. Spring. Exception Handling
18. Spring Security

Each sprint was allocated three days, which containe a theoretical part and tasks. Tasks were performed in a team of 3-4 people. For each task, the team changed to learn to work in a team. And also from the beginning of the new sprint we were sent an ideal version of the program to solve the next task, so we can learn solutions from a professional developer and work on errors and continue to perform tasks on code without bugs. Therefore, this work is a perfect variation of what we tried to create during this course for 9 weeks in teamwork.
